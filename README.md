#POLYSCAN â€“ Election Contributions Analytics

ðŸ“Œ Overview

Polyscan is an end-to-end big data analytics platform that leverages the publicly available OpenFEC (Federal Election Commission) datasets to uncover insights from U.S. political donation patterns. Built using a scalable AWS-based data pipeline architecture, the system enables political analysts, regulatory agencies, journalists, and the public to monitor political financing activities and detect anomalies with ease.

Our platform supports transparent, data-driven decisions in the electoral landscape by visualizing financial trends, flagging suspicious activities, and simplifying access to campaign finance data.


Main dataset:

https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/committee-master-file-description/

https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/candidate-master-file-description/


Individuals â†’ Committees: Contributions are made to committees (CMTE_ID).

Committees â†’ Candidates: Committees are linked to candidates (CAND_ID or CAND_PCC).

Candidates â†’ Elections: Candidate data includes election year, office, and party.



ðŸš€ The primary objectives of this project are:

To clean and structure the OpenFEC individual contributions dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis.

To identify and organize key featuresâ€”such as donation amounts, donor demographics, and transaction typesâ€”that influence donation patterns.

To detect unusual or potentially suspicious donations through well-defined, rule-based validation checks (excluding the use of machine learning).

To derive meaningful insights into donor behavior, including geographic origin, employment details, and socio-economic background.

To present complex trends and anomalies in political donations through clear, intuitive visualizations.

To develop a robust system or dashboard that enables analysts, campaign teams, and regulatory authorities to effectively explore and interpret political contribution data.
