# PoliScan
Introduction

Political donations are an important part of democracy. They help candidates run their campaigns and share their ideas with voters. To keep the system fair and trustworthy, it's important that the flow of money is open and transparent.
In the U.S., the Federal Election Commission (FEC) collects and shares detailed data about who donates to political campaigns. While this data is publicly available, it’s often large, complex, and hard to understand. As a result, it becomes difficult to spot important patterns, trends, or possible signs of illegal or suspicious activity.


Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:
•	Clean and organize the OpenFEC individual contributions data to make it ready for analysis.
•	Find and group important features (like amount, donor info, etc.) that affect donation patterns.
•	Spot unusual or suspicious donations using clear, rule-based checks (not machine learning).
•	Discover useful insights about who donates, where they come from, and their economic background.
•	Show complex donation trends and odd patterns through simple and clear visualizations.
•	Build a tool or system that helps analysts, campaign teams, and government bodies better understand and use political donation data.



This project helps turn complex political donation data into clear and useful information. It allows people like analysts, campaign teams, and officials to see patterns, find unusual donations, and better understand who is funding politics.
By making this information easier to explore, the project supports fairness, transparency, and trust in the election process. It gives the tools needed to keep political financing open and accountable — helping strengthen democracy in the U.S.
